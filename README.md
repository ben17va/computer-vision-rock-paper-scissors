# Computer Vision RPS
# Starting project
# An image project model was created with four different classes; rock, paper, scissors and a nothing class with an empty move. Teachable machine was used to create this model and was downloaded through the TensorFlow tab along with a text file containing the labels
# I have now finished writing the code for the basic rock paper scissors game where user input is required and you can play against the computer.
# I have finished up the project fully with the game working now. I decided to create a class called RPS to make it easy with the number of functions i would be using and created attributes that made it easier throughout the code. 
# I had to first integrate the user choice with the RPS-Template given and did so my creating a max_value_index which then used the np.argmax feature to find the index of highest probability in the list. I copied my get winner function from the manual_rps file which allowed for me to find the winner of the game however made some simple changes such as using full words (paper) rather than letters (p). I also copied my get_computer function which simply allowed for the random choice of the computer to be made from the list using the random.choice option. My last function within the class was the three_rounds function which made sure the game continued till either the computer or user obtains three wins.

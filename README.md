# Computer Vision RPS
# Starting project
# An image project model was created with four different classes; rock, paper, scissors and a nothing class with an empty move. Teachable machine was used to create this model and was downloaded through the TensorFlow tab along with a text file containing the labels
# I have now finished writing the code for the basic rock paper scissors game where user input is required and you can play against the computer.
